# PSP Frontend (scaffold)

This folder contains a minimal Next.js + Tailwind scaffold for the PSP dashboard.

Install and run locally:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

This initial scaffold includes design tokens (dark-first, Electric Indigo accent), global styles with `tabular-nums` utility, and component/hook stubs to implement next.
